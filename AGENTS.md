# Repository working rules

- Preserve the root pilot design unless the user asks for a design revision.
- Keep each experiment implementation self-contained in a clearly numbered,
  descriptive directory, such as `01_implementation_validation_v1`.
- Once an implementation has been validated and delivered, treat that directory
  as a frozen version. Subsequent implementation or experimental changes belong
  in a new directory. Do not make old versions import code from newer versions.
- During development, each verification run must use a new output directory and
  retain a snapshot/hash of the source it actually ran. Preserve failed runs.
- Do not overwrite existing run directories or checkpoints.
- Record configuration, dependency versions, source hashes, seeds, actual costs,
  and failed checks. A smoke test is not evidence of a scientific effect.
- Current authorized execution is implementation validation. P0 pretraining and
  the ten research branches are separate execution stages.
